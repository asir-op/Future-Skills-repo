Question: . Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Answer:

the tables product and product_category are related with each other with the help of a foreign key assigned at category_id of product table which is pointing towards product_category, enabling each product to be associated with a specific category defined in the Product_Category table.



Question: How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Answer: 

The category_id column in the "Product" table is a foreign key that references the id column in the "Product_Category" table. By setting up a foreign key constraint, we ensure that every value in the category_id column of the "Product" table must exist in the id column of the "Product_Category" table. This constraint guarantees referential integrity, meaning each product's category_id must correspond to an existing category in the "Product_Category" table. When inserting or updating a product in the "Product" table, validate that the category_id provided exists in the "Product_Category" table. This validation step ensures that only valid category IDs are assigned to products. If the category_id does not exist in the "Product_Category" table, the operation should fail or raise an error, preventing invalid data from being added.
